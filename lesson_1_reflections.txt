The computer actually helped me saving a lot of time and frustrating moments by scanning through the document in less than one second.
This was really useful because otherwise I would have wasted a lot of time by searching the error.
Fortunately doing this was really easy. I like the Eingabeaufforderung of Windows. I've never used this function before.
I think a long time ago it was really time consuming scanning your previous versions and recognizing all the changes the programmer made.
This is really useful and efficient.
Pros: you can commit manually whats important instead letting save your changes by the computer, it's easy and fast
Cons: you could forget to commit a change
Git is helping programmers to keep track of changes in their code. Google Docs just saves documents that aren't connected.
git log shows all the commits made
git diff compares two commits by using their ids
I can always downgrade to an older version of my code. Knowing this makes me feeling more adventurous.
I will test some changes in the code of my Android app.
